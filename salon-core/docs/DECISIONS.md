# Decisions

- 2026-01-26 Centralize audit/status artifacts in salon-core/docs (owner: team, rationale: salon-core is the integration hub and already hosts system docs).
- 2026-01-26 Use docs/roadmap-real-tests.md as the source of truth for readiness until real tests pass (owner: team, rationale: most detailed and up to date).
